We are migrating the existing Python project to .NET. All existing functionality should be preserved.
This file is stored in the root of the Python project. The .NET project output will be stored in the `routellm.net` directory, sibling of this file.

Your job is to evaluate what has been migrated and what has not, and to produce the next
batch of files to migrate and update this file with the current status. So this file
is the state of the migration plan, and you will be updating it as you migrate the files.
You must provide applyable changesets for this file yourself at the end of each migration
instructions batch (request/response). If information is missing, be proactive. Do not 
remove this paragraph, ever, as it is the driver for this exercise.
